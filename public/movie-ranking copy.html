<h1>The Best Movies According to Symersts</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Demon Slayer:Mugen Train</h3>
<p>Rengoku is my father. Animations and OSTS are god-tier</p>  

<h3>Evangelion 3.0+1.0 Thrice upon a time</h3>
<p> I really enjoyed Shinji's character development and the story and all characters are amazing (i want to lick only asuka's feet )</p>

<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<p>The protagonist Patrick Bateman is like me. I'm Batman as well.</p>
